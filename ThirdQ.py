#The space complexity of the provided solution is O(m * n), where m is the length of the generated string and n is the number of iterations. This is because at each iteration, a new string is generated based on the previous string.

#The time complexity of the provided solution is O(m * n * k), where m is the length of the generated string, n is the number of iterations, and k is the average number of rules that apply to each character in the string. This is because for each character in the string, we potentially need to check each rule to see if it applies.
